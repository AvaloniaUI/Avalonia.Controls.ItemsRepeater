# Avalonia `ItemsRepeater`

## Introduction

`ItemsRepeater` control and associated infrastructure ported from the WinUI library: https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml
Previously this port was part of the Avalonia package itself, but we gradually detach it into separated package and now - separated repository.

## Current Status

The control is currently *retired*.
If possible, it is recommended to use build-in ItemsControl based controls from Avalonia package.
We are still accepting fixes and pull requests for ItemsRepeater controls, and we planning to keep it compatible with latest version of Avalonia up to 12.0 release.
